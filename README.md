# üèîÔ∏è Alpine - chown
![size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/11notes/chown/stable?color=0eb305) ![version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/11notes/chown/stable?color=eb7a09) ![pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/11notes/chown?color=2b75d6)

**chown, everything!**

# SYNOPSIS
**What can I do with this?** Well, simply put all it does is chown everything as 1000:1000 in the volume /chown. So, you can mount bind mounts or volumes and auto chown them with the correct UID/GID for docker by default. You can also easily depend other services on this, so that they only start after the volumes or bind mounts were created and have the correct permission.

It solves the issues that volumes or bind mounts can‚Äôt be set with permissions when newly created.

# VOLUMES
* **/chown** - Directory being chowned
